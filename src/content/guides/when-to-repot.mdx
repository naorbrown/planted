Your plant has been in the same pot for a year, maybe two, and something feels off. Growth has slowed. Water runs straight through the drainage hole without soaking in. You can see roots poking out the bottom. Everyone says "repot it," but nobody explains when that is actually necessary versus when you should leave it alone. The truth is that most plants are repotted too often, too aggressively, or at the wrong time of year. All three mistakes stress the plant more than staying slightly root-bound ever would.

This guide tells you how to read the actual signs, choose the right pot and soil, do the repotting without damaging the roots, and handle the recovery period afterward. No guessing, no unnecessary repotting.

## Signs Your Plant Needs Repotting

Not every slow-growing plant needs a bigger pot. Look for multiple signs occurring together before you commit to repotting.

**Roots circling the bottom of the pot.** Tip the plant out of its pot and look at the root ball. If roots are wrapping around the outside of the soil in tight circles, the plant has exhausted the available space. A few roots at the bottom are normal. A solid mat of roots with almost no visible soil means the plant is root-bound.

**Water running straight through without absorbing.** When roots fill the pot, they displace soil. Less soil means less moisture retention. If water pours in the top and immediately exits the drainage hole without the soil getting wet, there is not enough soil left to hold it. The roots are drinking from a nearly empty reservoir.

**Growth has stalled despite good conditions.** If your monstera was putting out a new leaf every month and has not produced one in three months, despite adequate light, water, and fertilizer during growing season, the root system may have hit its limit. The plant cannot grow more foliage than its roots can support.

**Roots poking out of drainage holes or above the soil surface.** This is the most visible sign, but by itself it does not always mean you need to repot. Some plants, like golden pothos and monsteras, produce aerial roots as a normal growth behavior. But if those roots are accompanied by the other signs above, it is time.

**The pot is physically unstable.** A top-heavy plant in a lightweight plastic pot that tips over constantly has outgrown its base. This is as much a practical issue as a horticultural one.

## Choosing the Right Pot

The pot you choose matters more than you think. Getting it wrong causes more problems than staying in the original container.

**Size up by one to two inches in diameter.** This is the most important rule. A plant in a six-inch pot goes into a seven- or eight-inch pot. Not a twelve-inch pot. A pot that is too large holds excess soil that stays wet long after the roots have taken what they need. That wet, unused soil becomes a breeding ground for root rot. Oversized pots kill more repotted plants than any other mistake.

**Drainage holes are non-negotiable.** If the pot does not have at least one hole in the bottom, do not use it as a primary pot. Use it as a cachepot -- a decorative outer container that holds the functional inner pot. Remove the inner pot to water, let it drain completely, then return it to the cachepot. Standing water in a sealed pot is a death sentence.

**Material affects watering frequency.** Terracotta is porous and wicks moisture through its walls, drying soil faster. It is ideal for plants that hate wet feet: snake plants, ZZ plants, succulents, fiddle leaf figs. Glazed ceramic and plastic retain moisture longer, which suits plants that like consistent moisture: ferns, calatheas, peace lilies. Choose the material that matches your plant's water preferences, not just your aesthetic preferences.

## Choosing the Right Soil

Different plants need different soil structures. Using the wrong mix is a common source of post-repotting problems.

**Standard indoor potting mix** works for most tropical foliage plants: pothos, philodendrons, peace lilies, and spider plants. It holds moderate moisture, provides reasonable drainage, and contains enough organic matter to support growth. This is your default choice when you are unsure.

**Cactus and succulent mix** drains fast and holds minimal water. Use it for snake plants, ZZ plants, jade plants, ponytail palms, and any plant that rots easily in wet soil. You can make your own by mixing standard potting soil with equal parts perlite and coarse sand.

**Chunky aroid mix** is for epiphytic plants like monsteras, philodendrons, and orchids. These plants naturally grow on trees, not in soil, and their roots need air circulation. Mix standard potting soil with orchid bark, perlite, and charcoal in roughly equal parts. The result is a loose, chunky medium that drains instantly and provides the air pockets these roots crave. A monstera repotted into dense standard mix often develops root rot within months. Give it bark.

**When in doubt, add perlite.** If your soil feels heavy and stays wet for more than a week after watering, mix in extra perlite (the white, lightweight volcanic glass). It improves drainage and aeration without changing the nutrient profile. More perlite is almost never a mistake.

## How to Repot Step by Step

Gather everything before you start: new pot, fresh soil, scissors or pruning shears, a tarp or newspaper to catch mess, and water.

1. **Water the plant one to two days before repotting.** Moist soil holds together better and slides out of the old pot more easily. Bone-dry soil crumbles and exposes roots to air damage. Saturated soil is heavy and messy. Aim for evenly moist.

2. **Remove the plant from the old pot.** Turn the pot on its side, grip the base of the stems, and slide the plant out. If it is stuck, squeeze the sides of a plastic pot or run a knife around the inside edge of a ceramic pot. Do not yank the plant by its stems.

3. **Inspect and loosen the roots.** Gently tease apart circling roots with your fingers. If the root ball is a solid, compacted mass, use your fingers or a chopstick to loosen the outer layer. You are not trying to remove all the old soil -- just break up the outer ring of circling roots so they grow outward into the new soil instead of continuing to circle.

4. **Trim dead or rotten roots.** Healthy roots are white or light tan and firm. Dead roots are dark brown or black, mushy, and may smell sour. Cut them off with clean scissors. If you find significant rot, trim aggressively -- the plant will recover better from a smaller healthy root system than from a large rotting one.

5. **Add soil to the new pot.** Put a layer of fresh soil in the bottom of the new pot. The depth should be enough that when you place the plant on top, the soil line sits about half an inch below the pot rim. You want room to water without overflow.

6. **Place the plant and backfill.** Set the plant in the center of the new pot, keeping it at the same depth it was in the old pot. Do not bury the stem deeper than it was -- buried stems rot. Fill in around the root ball with fresh soil, pressing gently to eliminate large air pockets. Do not pack it down hard; roots need some air space.

7. **Water thoroughly.** Water until it flows from the drainage hole. This settles the soil around the roots and hydrates the fresh medium. Let it drain completely.

## Recovery After Repotting

Repotting is surgery. Expect your plant to look worse before it looks better.

**Mild wilting for a few days is normal.** The roots were disturbed and need time to reestablish contact with the new soil. A pothos or peace lily may droop for three to five days. A fiddle leaf fig might drop a leaf or two. This is stress response, not failure.

**Do not fertilize for four to six weeks.** Fresh potting soil contains enough nutrients to sustain the plant during recovery. Adding fertilizer to stressed, potentially damaged roots risks chemical burn. Wait until you see new growth before feeding.

**Keep the plant in its usual spot.** Do not move it to a sunnier window or a shadier corner "to help it recover." Changing the light conditions on top of the root disturbance doubles the stress. Stability is what the plant needs right now.

**Resume normal watering once the top inch of soil is dry.** Some guides say to water less after repotting. That is wrong for most plants. The new soil needs moisture to encourage root growth into the fresh medium. Water when the soil tells you to -- not on a new schedule imposed by anxiety.

## Setup Tips

**Repot in spring or early summer.** This is when most houseplants are entering their active growth period. Roots recover faster and grow into new soil quickly when the plant is already in growth mode. Repotting in fall or winter means the plant sits in new soil with damaged roots and no growth energy to repair them. If you must repot in winter because the plant is desperate, do it -- but understand recovery will be slow.

**Never repot a sick plant.** If your plant has pests, disease, or significant rot, address those problems first. Repotting adds stress, and a sick plant cannot handle additional stress. Fix the health issue, let the plant stabilize, then repot when it is strong enough.

**Annual repotting is not a rule.** Some plants thrive being slightly root-bound. Snake plants, ZZ plants, and peace lilies often bloom more when their roots are snug. Repot only when you see the signs described above, not because the calendar says so. Many houseplants can stay in the same pot for two to three years with occasional top-dressing of fresh soil.
