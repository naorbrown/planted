When someone you care about is grieving, the impulse is to send flowers. And flowers are fine -- they are beautiful, they are expected, and they communicate what words often cannot. But flowers die within a week, and there is something uncomfortable about a sympathy gift that is itself temporary. A living plant says something different: this is here to stay, the way your memory of them is here to stay.

The right memorial plant is one that lives for years, asks little of someone who may not have the energy for care routines, and carries some kind of meaning beyond being decorative. These three have been given as sympathy and memorial plants for decades, and for good reasons.

## Peace Lily

The peace lily is the most traditional sympathy plant, and the tradition exists because it earns the role. The white spathes -- the elegant hooded blooms that rise above the dark green foliage -- have symbolized peace, renewal, and remembrance across cultures for centuries. When you send a peace lily, the recipient understands the gesture immediately. It is not ambiguous.

Beyond symbolism, peace lily is remarkably well-suited to the conditions of a grieving household. It tolerates low light, which means it does not need a sunny windowsill -- it can sit on a table in a dim living room, exactly where someone will see it every day. It communicates its needs clearly: when it needs water, the leaves droop visibly. Water it, and they perk back up within hours. There is no guessing, no soil-moisture meters, no complex schedule. This is important. A person processing loss should not have to worry about killing the plant someone sent them.

Peace lily also appeared in NASA's Clean Air Study as one of the most effective plants for removing formaldehyde, benzene, and trichloroethylene from indoor air. It is not just symbolic -- it is quietly functional.

**Difficulty:** Beginner
**Light:** Low to medium indirect. Thrives in dim rooms.
**Water:** When leaves droop slightly. Very clear communicator.
**Pet-safe:** No -- toxic to cats and dogs if ingested (calcium oxalate).
**Child-safe:** No -- mildly toxic if ingested.

[Peace Lily](/planted/plants/air-wellness/peace-lily/) is the classic sympathy plant. Its meaning is understood, its care is simple, and it blooms reliably in low light.

## Jade Plant

Where peace lily communicates through symbolism, jade plant communicates through endurance. A well-cared-for jade plant lives 70 to 100 years. That is not a typo. The plant you give someone today can be with them through moves, marriages, career changes, and decades of ordinary life. It grows slowly, develops a thick woody trunk over time, and becomes more beautiful and sculptural with age.

In many cultures, jade symbolizes prosperity, growth, and lasting friendship. As a memorial gift, the longevity carries the weight. This is not a plant that represents a moment -- it represents a timeline. A jade plant given at a difficult time can become the oldest living thing in someone's home, a quiet marker of the years since their loss and everything that happened after.

The care is minimal. Jade is a succulent -- it stores water in its thick, fleshy leaves and needs watering only every two to three weeks. It wants a bright windowsill, which is its one specific requirement. But once placed, it asks for almost nothing. It will not punish someone for forgetting about it during a hard week. It will not drop leaves or wilt dramatically. It just persists, slowly, year after year.

**Difficulty:** Beginner
**Light:** Bright direct to bright indirect. Needs a sunny windowsill.
**Water:** Every 2-3 weeks. Succulent -- stores water in leaves.
**Pet-safe:** No -- toxic to cats and dogs.
**Child-safe:** Mildly toxic if ingested in quantity.

[Jade Plant](/planted/plants/low-maintenance/jade-plant/) is the plant that will still be alive in fifty years. For a memorial, that longevity says what words cannot.

## Parlor Palm

The parlor palm has been a memorial and mourning plant since the Victorian era, when it was placed in parlors -- the formal rooms where families received condolence visits and sat with their grief. The association is historical, not invented. Victorians chose it because it was elegant, thrived in the dim gaslit interiors of parlors, and required little attention from households consumed by mourning.

That same combination works today. Parlor palm is graceful without being showy -- arching, feathery fronds on slender stems that add a living presence to a room without demanding attention. It tolerates the low-light conditions of most living rooms. It needs water once a week and no special care beyond that. And it is completely non-toxic to cats, dogs, and children, which matters when you are sending a plant into a home whose composition you may not know entirely.

The visual character is different from peace lily or jade. Where peace lily is bold and symbolic, and jade is compact and enduring, parlor palm is quiet and dignified. It does not dominate a room. It accompanies it. For some recipients, that subtlety is exactly right.

**Difficulty:** Beginner
**Light:** Low to medium indirect. Evolved for forest understory shade.
**Water:** When top inch of soil is dry. Roughly weekly.
**Pet-safe:** Yes
**Child-safe:** Yes

[Parlor Palm](/planted/plants/pet-safe/parlor-palm/) carries a history of consolation. It is the memorial plant for someone who values understatement.

## Setup Tips

**If they have pets, choose parlor palm.** Both peace lily and jade are toxic to cats and dogs. Parlor palm is the only fully pet-safe option on this list, and it carries its own historical weight as a memorial plant. Do not create an additional problem for a grieving household by sending a plant that threatens their animals.

**Include a note about the plant, not just your condolences.** A single line -- "Jade plants live for a hundred years" or "Parlor palms have been kept in memory since the Victorian era" -- gives the recipient a reason to keep the plant beyond obligation. Meaning helps people care for things during times when motivation is low.

**Send it in a simple, quality pot.** White or matte ceramic. No bright colors, no novelty shapes, no printed messages. The plant should feel dignified, like the gesture it represents. A saucer is not optional -- a grieving person should not have to deal with water rings on their furniture.

**Do not send a high-maintenance plant.** This is not the time for orchids, fiddle leaf figs, or anything that punishes inconsistent care. The recipient may go through weeks where they barely notice the plant. It needs to survive that. Peace lily, jade, and parlor palm all do.
