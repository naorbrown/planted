Your plant looked fine for weeks and now something is wrong. Leaves are turning yellow, or brown, or drooping, or all three at once. You search online and get a list of fifteen possible causes for each symptom, ranging from "slightly too much water" to "rare tropical virus." That is not helpful when you are staring at a sick plant with no diagnostic training.

Here is the reality: ninety percent of houseplant problems come from five issues, and most of them are fixable if you catch them early. The key is matching your symptom to the most likely cause, not the rarest one. This guide walks through each common symptom, tells you the probable culprit, and gives you the fix. No guessing, no panic.

## Yellow Leaves

Yellow leaves are the most common distress signal, and the most confusing one because multiple problems produce the same symptom. Start with the most likely cause and work down.

**Most likely cause: overwatering.** If the yellowing starts with the lower leaves and the soil feels damp, you are watering too often. The roots are suffocating in saturated soil. Golden pothos, peace lilies, and snake plants all show this pattern -- the oldest leaves yellow first because the plant sacrifices them to conserve energy for new growth. Fix: let the soil dry completely before watering again. Check that your pot has drainage holes and that the saucer is not holding standing water.

**Second most likely: natural aging.** Plants shed old leaves. It is normal. If your plant is producing healthy new growth at the top while one or two lower leaves turn yellow and drop, that is not a problem -- it is lifecycle maintenance. This is especially common in pothos, philodendrons, and peace lilies. Fix: nothing. Remove the yellow leaf cleanly and move on.

**Third possibility: insufficient light.** A plant in a spot too dim for its needs will yellow gradually, starting with the leaves farthest from the light source. The plant is cannibalizing leaves it cannot photosynthesize with. Fix: move it closer to a window or supplement with a grow light. This is a slow decline, so you have time to experiment with placement.

## Brown Leaf Tips

Brown, crispy tips are almost always an environmental issue, not a disease. The plant is losing moisture from the leaf edges faster than it can replace it.

**Most likely cause: low humidity.** Indoor air, especially in winter with forced-air heating, can drop below 30% relative humidity. Tropical plants like peace lilies, calatheas, and Boston ferns evolved in 60-80% humidity. Their leaf tips dry out and brown in arid indoor air. Fix: group humidity-loving plants together (they create a shared microclimate), use a pebble tray with water beneath the pot, or run a humidifier nearby. Misting is mostly useless -- it raises humidity for about fifteen minutes before evaporating.

**Second possibility: inconsistent watering.** Alternating between bone-dry soil and sudden saturation stresses the plant. The roots cannot maintain steady moisture delivery to leaf tips, and the tips brown as a result. Fix: water consistently when the top inch or two of soil is dry. Do not let the soil go from desert to flood.

**Third possibility: mineral buildup from tap water.** If your tap water is hard (high in calcium, chlorine, or fluoride), those minerals accumulate in the soil and eventually burn leaf tips. Spider plants and dracaenas are especially sensitive. Fix: switch to filtered water or let tap water sit out overnight to off-gas chlorine. Flush the soil monthly by running water through it for several minutes.

## Drooping or Wilting

A drooping plant looks alarming, but it is actually one of the easier problems to diagnose because the cause is almost always water-related.

**Most likely cause: underwatering.** The plant has used up the moisture in the soil and its cells have lost turgor pressure -- the internal water pressure that keeps stems and leaves rigid. Peace lilies are famous for this; they wilt dramatically when dry and snap back upright within hours of watering. Golden pothos does the same thing. Fix: water thoroughly until it drains from the bottom. If the soil has pulled away from the pot edges (a sign of severe dryness), soak the entire pot in a basin of water for twenty minutes to rehydrate the soil evenly.

**Second possibility: overwatering and root rot.** This is the tricky one. A plant with rotting roots cannot absorb water, so it wilts even though the soil is wet. If your plant is drooping AND the soil is soggy, do not add more water. You have the opposite problem. Fix: unpot the plant, inspect the roots. Healthy roots are white or tan and firm. Rotten roots are brown, black, mushy, and smell bad. Trim all rotten roots with clean scissors, repot in fresh dry soil, and do not water for several days.

**Third possibility: temperature shock.** A plant placed near a cold draft, an air conditioning vent, or a hot radiator can wilt from sudden temperature changes. Tropical plants like peace lilies and pothos prefer stable temperatures between 65-80F. Fix: move the plant away from temperature extremes and let it recover.

## Mushy Stems and Root Rot

If stems are soft, brown, and mushy at the base, the problem has moved past yellow leaves into structural failure. This is root rot, and it is the number one killer of indoor plants.

**Cause: prolonged overwatering.** Soil that stays wet for too long becomes anaerobic -- the oxygen in the soil is displaced by water, and the beneficial bacteria that keep roots healthy are replaced by fungi that decompose living tissue. The roots die first, then the rot moves up the stems. Snake plants are especially vulnerable because their thick, water-storing leaves mask the problem; by the time the base feels mushy, the rot is advanced.

**How to attempt a rescue:** Remove the plant from its pot. Wash all soil off the roots under running water. Cut away every root that is brown, black, or mushy -- cut until you see only white, firm tissue, even if that means removing most of the root system. Let the remaining roots air-dry for a few hours. Repot in fresh, dry cactus mix in a clean pot with drainage. Do not water for five to seven days. The survival rate depends on how much healthy root tissue remains. If the rot has reached the main stem, the plant is likely gone.

**Prevention is easier than cure.** Use pots with drainage holes. Use fast-draining soil. Water only when the soil is dry. These three rules prevent virtually all root rot.

## Leggy or Stretched Growth

Your plant is growing, but it looks wrong -- long, thin stems with wide gaps between leaves, reaching sideways toward a window instead of growing full and compact. This is etiolation.

**Cause: insufficient light.** The plant is stretching toward the nearest light source because it is not getting enough where it is. The internodes (the spaces between leaf nodes) elongate as the plant puts its energy into reaching light rather than producing foliage. Golden pothos and snake plants tolerate low light, but even they will stretch and thin out if the light is too dim. Fiddle leaf figs and monsteras show it dramatically.

**How to fix it:** Move the plant to a brighter location. The stretched growth will not reverse -- those long internodes are permanent. But new growth will be compact and full once the light improves. If the legginess bothers you, prune the stretched sections back to a node. The plant will branch from that point and fill in. For trailing plants like pothos, cut the leggy vine and propagate the cutting in water -- you get a new plant and the mother plant redirects energy into fuller growth.

**Prevention:** Match your plant to your light. If your brightest spot is still dim, choose plants that genuinely thrive in low light -- ZZ plant, cast iron plant, or pothos -- rather than trying to force a high-light plant into conditions it will never adapt to.

## When to Give Up

Not every plant can be saved. Knowing when to stop trying is part of plant care.

**The plant is dead if:** the stems are completely mushy from soil to tip, the roots are entirely brown and disintegrating, the leaves are all brown and crispy with no green tissue remaining, or the main stem snaps when you gently bend it. At that point, you are keeping a corpse in a pot. Compost it, clean the pot, and try again.

**The plant might recover if:** there is any firm, green tissue on the stem, any white roots in the root ball, or any leaves with green sections remaining. Plants are remarkably resilient. A pothos with one surviving node can regrow an entire vine. A snake plant with a single healthy leaf can produce new growth from the rhizome. Do not give up until the plant gives you nothing to work with.

**Do not blame yourself for every death.** Some plants arrive from the nursery with root rot already developing. Some get pests from neighboring plants at the store. Some were grown in greenhouse conditions so different from your apartment that no amount of care bridges the gap. Losing a plant does not make you a bad plant parent. It makes you someone who is learning. Replace it and apply what the dead one taught you.
