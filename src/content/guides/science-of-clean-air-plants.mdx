## The NASA Clean Air Study

In 1989, NASA scientist Dr. Bill Wolverton published a study that would permanently change how people think about houseplants. The research, conducted for NASA's Stennis Space Center, investigated whether common houseplants could remove volatile organic compounds (VOCs) from sealed environments -- a critical question for long-duration space missions where astronauts breathe recirculated air.

The study tested roughly a dozen common houseplants in sealed chambers. Researchers introduced specific VOCs -- formaldehyde, benzene, and trichloroethylene -- and measured how effectively each plant reduced concentrations over 24 hours. The results were striking: plants like peace lilies, golden pothos, and English ivy removed significant percentages of these toxins from the air.

The study was rigorous for its scope but limited by its context. The sealed chambers were small, the concentrations were controlled, and there was no competition from the natural air exchange that occurs in a real home. Understanding these limitations is essential to applying the findings honestly.

## Common Indoor Pollutants

The VOCs that Wolverton tested are not exotic laboratory chemicals. They are present in most homes.

**Formaldehyde** is the most pervasive indoor air pollutant. It off-gasses from pressed-wood furniture, laminate flooring, plywood, insulation, some fabrics, and even paper products. At elevated concentrations it causes eye irritation, headaches, and respiratory issues.

**Benzene** is found in paints, varnishes, detergents, plastics, synthetic fibers, tobacco smoke, and vehicle exhaust that enters through attached garages. It is a known carcinogen with long-term exposure.

**Trichloroethylene** (TCE) appears in adhesives, paint removers, spot cleaners, and some rug-cleaning solutions. It affects the central nervous system and has been linked to liver and kidney damage.

**Xylene and toluene** come from paints, lacquers, and printing inks. **Ammonia** is found in cleaning products, fertilizers, and some floor waxes. All were included in Wolverton's expanded research.

New furniture, fresh paint, and recently renovated rooms have the highest VOC concentrations. Levels decrease as materials age, but in poorly ventilated spaces they can remain elevated for months.

## How Plants Clean Air

Plants remove air pollutants through three mechanisms working together.

**Stomatal absorption.** Leaves have tiny pores called stomata that open to exchange gases during photosynthesis. When they take in carbon dioxide, they also absorb airborne VOCs. The plant then metabolizes these compounds, breaking them down into harmless byproducts or incorporating them into plant tissue.

**Root zone microbes.** The soil around plant roots hosts colonies of microorganisms that are surprisingly effective at breaking down organic chemicals. Wolverton's research found that the root zone was often more effective at VOC removal than the leaves themselves. These microbes use VOCs as a food source, converting them to carbon dioxide and water.

**Soil filtration.** As air circulates near the soil surface, pollutants are adsorbed by the growing medium -- particularly activated carbon, which Wolverton recommended adding to potting mixes to boost filtration capacity.

The combination of these pathways means that a healthy, well-maintained plant with exposed soil surface and robust root growth is more effective at air cleaning than a stressed plant in compacted soil.

## How Many Plants Do You Need?

This is where the conversation gets complicated.

Wolverton's original recommendation was approximately one plant per 100 square feet of living space, or roughly 15 to 18 plants for an average home of 1,800 square feet. This figure became widely cited and is still repeated in most articles about air-purifying plants.

However, modern environmental scientists have pushed back. A widely discussed 2019 analysis by researchers at Drexel University reviewed decades of studies and concluded that you would need between 10 and 1,000 plants per square meter to match the air cleaning rate of simply opening a window or running a basic HVAC system. In a typical room, that means hundreds of plants.

The truth sits between the extremes. Plants do remove VOCs -- the chemistry is real and reproducible. But in a normal home with natural air exchange, their contribution to overall air quality is modest compared to ventilation, source control (choosing low-VOC products), and mechanical filtration. Plants are a supplement, not a substitute.

## Top 10 Air-Purifying Plants

Based on Wolverton's research and subsequent studies, these plants demonstrated the strongest VOC removal rates:

1. **Peace lily** -- removed all three major VOCs and also absorbs ammonia
2. **Golden pothos** -- effective against formaldehyde, thrives in low light
3. **Snake plant** -- one of the few plants that converts CO2 to oxygen at night
4. **Boston fern** -- the highest formaldehyde removal rate in the original study
5. **English ivy** -- effective against benzene and formaldehyde
6. **Bamboo palm** -- strong formaldehyde and xylene absorption
7. **Rubber plant** -- effective formaldehyde removal with minimal care requirements
8. **Dracaena** (various species) -- multiple species showed strong TCE absorption
9. **Spider plant** -- reliable formaldehyde removal and extremely easy to grow
10. **Chrysanthemum** -- removed the most VOC types of any plant tested, though it only blooms temporarily indoors

## Beyond Air Quality

Even if the air-purification effect is modest in a real-world home, plants provide well-documented benefits that go beyond VOC removal.

**Humidity.** Plants release water vapor through transpiration. A room with several plants can see a measurable increase in relative humidity, which benefits respiratory health, skin hydration, and even reduces static electricity in dry climates.

**Oxygen production.** While the oxygen contribution of a few houseplants is negligible compared to outdoor air exchange, plants do convert CO2 to oxygen during photosynthesis. Snake plants are notable for performing this process at night via CAM photosynthesis, making them popular bedroom plants.

**Psychological benefits.** Multiple studies have shown that the presence of indoor plants reduces perceived stress, improves concentration, and boosts self-reported well-being. A 2015 study published in the Journal of Physiological Anthropology found that interacting with indoor plants reduced both physiological and psychological stress markers compared to computer-based tasks.

## A Balanced Perspective

Plants genuinely improve indoor environments. The science supporting VOC removal is real, the humidity benefits are measurable, and the psychological effects are well-documented. But honesty matters: a few potted plants will not replace proper ventilation, air filtration, or thoughtful material choices in your home.

The most effective strategy combines all of these approaches. Choose low-VOC paints, furniture, and cleaning products. Ensure adequate ventilation by opening windows regularly or maintaining your HVAC system. Use a quality air purifier if you live in an area with high outdoor pollution or have specific sensitivities.

Then add plants -- generously. Not because they are tiny HVAC units, but because they improve your space in a dozen ways that a filter cannot. They add life, humidity, visual calm, and a daily practice of attentiveness. The air quality benefit is a bonus on top of everything else they bring.
