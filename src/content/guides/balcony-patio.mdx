You have a balcony. It has a chair you barely use, maybe a dead plant from a previous attempt, and a view that would be nicer if the foreground were not bare concrete and a metal railing. You have thought about putting plants out there, but outdoor growing feels more complicated -- sun exposure, wind, weather, drainage, the fear that everything will die the first time you forget to water during a hot week. The internet tells you to grow tomatoes or start a container garden, which sounds like signing up for a part-time job. You do not need a garden. You need three pots of herbs that look good, smell good, and survive real outdoor conditions with minimal intervention.

## Rosemary

Rosemary is the ideal balcony plant because it evolved for exactly the conditions a balcony provides: full sun, well-drained soil, dry heat, and wind. It is a Mediterranean shrub that grows wild on rocky, exposed hillsides with poor soil and little rain. Your sunny, windy balcony is closer to its natural habitat than any spot inside your apartment.

In a container on a south- or west-facing balcony, rosemary grows into a dense, aromatic shrub that looks good year-round. It is evergreen, which means it holds its needle-like leaves through winter in most climates. It smells incredible -- brush the foliage walking past and the air fills with that sharp, piney, resinous scent. And it is useful: clip sprigs for cooking whenever you want them. A single rosemary plant on a balcony supplies more fresh rosemary than you will use in a year.

The key to outdoor rosemary is drainage. Use a pot with large drainage holes and a gritty, fast-draining soil mix -- cactus mix or standard potting soil amended with perlite and coarse sand. Rosemary roots rot in wet soil faster than almost any other herb. On a balcony where rain can saturate pots, drainage is not optional.

**Difficulty:** Beginner
**Light:** Full sun -- 6+ hours of direct sunlight. South- or west-facing balcony.
**Water:** When soil is dry. Every 7-10 days outdoors. Drought-tolerant once established.
**Pet-safe:** Yes
**Child-safe:** Yes

## Sweet Basil

Basil is the summer balcony plant. From late spring through early fall, a pot of basil on a sunny balcony grows fast, smells extraordinary, and produces more leaves than you can eat. It turns a bare railing planter or a corner of your balcony into something that looks and smells intentionally cultivated. One or two pots of basil does more for the sensory experience of a balcony than any decorative plant.

Sweet basil needs heat and full sun -- at least six hours of direct sunlight per day. It is a warm-season annual, which means it grows aggressively in summer and dies at first frost. This is not a failure on your part; it is the plant's natural lifecycle. You get four to five months of vigorous growth and harvesting, and then you pull it out and start fresh next year. Accept this upfront and you will never feel guilty about a basil plant dying in October.

The trick with basil is pinching. Every time a stem develops a flower bud, pinch it off. Flowering triggers the plant to shift energy from leaf production to seed production, and the leaves become smaller and more bitter. Pinching the growing tips every week or two keeps the plant bushy, delays flowering, and maximizes the volume of harvestable leaves. It takes five seconds per plant and makes a huge difference.

**Difficulty:** Beginner
**Light:** Full sun -- 6-8 hours of direct sunlight. Needs a warm, sheltered spot.
**Water:** Keep soil consistently moist. Daily in hot weather. Basil wilts fast in dry soil.
**Pet-safe:** Yes
**Child-safe:** Yes

[Sweet Basil](/plant-therapy/plants/kitchen-herbs/sweet-basil/) is the best summer balcony plant you can grow. It fills the air with scent, fills your kitchen with fresh herbs, and fills a bare railing planter with dense green foliage.

## Mint

Mint is the plant you put in a pot and then watch take over. It grows so aggressively that gardeners warn against planting it in the ground, where it spreads via underground runners and colonizes entire beds. On a balcony, that aggression works in your favor: confined to a container, mint grows fast, fills the pot completely, and produces a constant supply of fresh leaves for tea, cocktails, cooking, and just crushing between your fingers on a warm evening.

Mint handles partial sun better than rosemary or basil, so it works on balconies that get four to five hours of direct light or dappled shade for part of the day. It is also more cold-tolerant than basil -- most mint varieties survive light frosts and come back in spring if the roots do not freeze solid. In milder climates, a pot of mint on the balcony is essentially permanent.

The care requirement is water. Mint is thirstier than rosemary and needs consistently moist soil, especially in summer heat. On a hot balcony, that can mean watering daily. Use a pot with a saucer to catch runoff, and check the soil every morning. The upside is that overwatering is nearly impossible with mint -- it tolerates wet conditions that would rot most herbs. If you are the type of person who waters too much, mint is your plant.

**Difficulty:** Beginner
**Light:** Full sun to partial shade. 4-6 hours of direct sunlight.
**Water:** Keep soil consistently moist. Daily in summer heat. Tolerates wet conditions.
**Pet-safe:** No -- menthol is toxic to cats and dogs. Keep containers out of pet reach.
**Child-safe:** Yes (culinary herb, safe for humans)

[Mint](/plant-therapy/plants/kitchen-herbs/mint/) is the easiest, most vigorous herb you can grow on a balcony. It fills its container, fills the air, and fills your glass with fresh leaves all season long.

## Setup Tips

**Use large pots.** Outdoor containers dry out faster than indoor ones because of sun and wind exposure. A minimum pot diameter of ten to twelve inches gives roots more soil volume to draw moisture from and reduces how often you need to water. Small pots on a hot balcony dry out in hours.

**Weight matters on a balcony.** Check your balcony's weight capacity before loading it with heavy ceramic pots and wet soil. Lightweight plastic or fiberglass pots are safer for upper-floor balconies and are easier to move when you need to rearrange or bring plants inside for winter.

**Group pots together against the building wall.** This creates a microclimate: the wall radiates stored heat, the grouped plants reduce wind exposure on each other, and watering runoff benefits neighboring pots. Plants on a balcony do better clustered than scattered.

**Rosemary is the permanent resident; basil is the seasonal guest.** Plant rosemary in the biggest, best-draining pot and give it the sunniest position. That pot stays year-round. Basil goes in a separate pot from May to October and gets replaced with nothing -- or a cool-season herb like parsley -- in winter.

**Do not forget to water in heat waves.** This is the one thing that separates outdoor container growing from indoor plant care. A 95-degree day with wind can dry out a basil pot in six hours. During peak summer, check soil moisture every morning. Set an alarm if you need to. The plants will forgive a lot, but not dehydration in full sun.
