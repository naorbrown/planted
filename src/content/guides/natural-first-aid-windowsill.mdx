There is a difference between folk remedy and clinical evidence. Elderberry syrup for colds, turmeric for everything, essential oils as antibiotics -- most of what gets called "natural medicine" online has weak or no controlled evidence behind it. This guide is not that.

The three plants here have been studied in randomized controlled trials, reviewed in meta-analyses, and in one case recognized by the FDA. They are not replacements for professional medical care. They are clinically supported tools for minor, everyday issues: a kitchen burn, an upset stomach, a stress headache that will not quit. Grow them on your windowsill and you have a small, functional pharmacy that also happens to look good.

## Aloe Vera

Aloe vera gel is an FDA-recognized skin protectant. This is not a marketing claim -- it is a regulatory classification based on clinical evidence. Studies have demonstrated that aloe gel accelerates healing of first- and second-degree burns, reduces wound healing time by up to eight days compared to conventional treatment, and provides immediate analgesic (pain-relieving) and anti-inflammatory effects on contact.

The use case is simple: you burn your hand on a pot, nick yourself with a kitchen knife, or get a mild sunburn. Snap off a lower leaf, slice it open, and apply the clear gel directly to the affected area. The gel contains acemannan, a polysaccharide that stimulates cell proliferation, along with salicylic acid (a natural anti-inflammatory) and several compounds with antimicrobial properties.

Place it in the kitchen. That is where burns happen, and having the remedy within arm's reach of the stove is the point. Aloe grows easily in a bright window, stores water in its thick leaves, and requires very little attention.

**Difficulty:** Beginner
**Light:** Bright indirect to bright direct. South- or west-facing window.
**Water:** Every 2-3 weeks. Let soil dry completely. Sandy, well-draining mix.
**Pet-safe:** No -- the latex layer between skin and gel is toxic to cats and dogs (causes vomiting, diarrhea, lethargy).
**Child-safe:** Yes (the inner gel is safe; the yellow latex just beneath the skin is a strong laxative and should not be ingested).

[Aloe Vera](/planted/plants/air-wellness/aloe-vera/) is your burn and wound treatment. Keep it within reach of wherever heat and sharp objects live.

## Mint

Peppermint is one of the most clinically studied digestive aids in herbal medicine. A 2019 meta-analysis published in BMC Complementary Medicine and Therapies reviewed 12 randomized controlled trials and found that peppermint oil significantly reduced symptoms of irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) -- including abdominal pain, bloating, and gas -- compared to placebo. The active compound, menthol, relaxes smooth muscle in the gastrointestinal tract.

You do not need capsules. A few fresh leaves steeped in hot water for five minutes makes a peppermint tea that delivers menthol directly. For nausea, chewing a fresh leaf provides faster onset. For tension headaches, crushing a leaf and inhaling the menthol has been shown to reduce perceived pain intensity -- a 1996 study in Cephalalgia found topical peppermint oil as effective as acetaminophen for tension headaches.

Mint also serves as an insect deterrent. The same menthol that soothes your stomach repels mosquitoes, ants, and flies. Place a pot near a kitchen window and you get culinary herb, digestive aid, and pest control in one plant.

One care note: mint is aggressive. It will take over any pot it shares with another plant. Always grow it in its own container. This is not a suggestion -- it is a requirement. Mint spreads by underground runners and will choke out anything growing beside it.

**Difficulty:** Beginner
**Light:** Medium to bright indirect. Tolerates partial shade.
**Water:** Keep soil consistently moist. Mint likes water more than most herbs.
**Pet-safe:** Yes (in small quantities; large amounts of concentrated menthol can irritate, but nibbling leaves is safe).
**Child-safe:** Yes

[Mint](/planted/plants/kitchen-herbs/mint/) is your digestive first responder. Tea for nausea, chewed leaf for stomach discomfort, crushed leaf for headache.

## Lavender

Lavender's clinical evidence is strongest as an anxiolytic -- a substance that reduces anxiety. Multiple randomized controlled trials have demonstrated that lavender aroma reduces salivary cortisol levels, lowers heart rate, and decreases self-reported anxiety scores. A 2019 systematic review in Phytomedicine analyzed 65 studies and concluded that both oral lavender oil supplements and aromatherapy exposure had significant anxiolytic effects comparable to low-dose benzodiazepines, without sedation or dependency risk.

For your windowsill pharmacy, lavender serves several roles. Dried flower buds steeped in hot water make a calming tea before bed. Sachets of dried flowers placed in drawers or under pillows provide sustained low-level aromatherapy. A sprig of fresh lavender crushed between your fingers and held near your nose for a few deep breaths is a surprisingly effective in-the-moment stress intervention.

Lavender also has mild antiseptic and anti-inflammatory properties. Historically used on minor cuts and insect bites, these applications have some supporting evidence though less robust than the anxiety data. Consider the antiseptic use a bonus, not the primary reason to grow it.

**Difficulty:** Beginner
**Light:** Bright direct. Needs 6+ hours of sun. South- or west-facing window.
**Water:** Let soil dry completely between waterings. Well-draining, sandy mix. Lavender hates wet feet.
**Pet-safe:** Yes
**Child-safe:** Yes

[Lavender](/planted/plants/bedroom/lavender/) is your stress and anxiety tool. Grow it for the aroma, harvest it for teas and sachets.

## What Science Supports vs. What Tradition Claims

Being honest about the evidence matters. Here is where each plant stands:

**Strong clinical evidence:** Aloe gel for burns and wound healing. Peppermint for IBS symptoms and digestive discomfort. Lavender for anxiety reduction and sleep improvement.

**Moderate evidence:** Peppermint for tension headaches. Aloe for minor cuts and skin irritation. Lavender for mild antiseptic use.

**Traditional use, limited evidence:** Aloe ingested internally for digestive issues (not recommended -- the latex is a harsh laxative). Mint as an antimicrobial. Lavender for pain relief beyond headache.

Stick to what is well-supported. These three plants do enough with strong evidence behind them that you do not need to stretch into unverified territory.

## Pet-Safe Note

Mint and lavender are pet-safe. Aloe is not -- the latex layer between the outer skin and inner gel contains anthraquinones that are toxic to cats and dogs, causing vomiting, diarrhea, and lethargy. If you have pets, place aloe on a high shelf or in a room they cannot access. There is no pet-safe plant with equivalent burn-treatment evidence, so elevation rather than substitution is the practical solution here.

## Setup Tips

**South-facing kitchen window is the ideal location.** Aloe and lavender both need bright light and well-draining soil. Mint tolerates slightly less light but still does best with several hours of sun. A single south-facing windowsill can hold all three.

**Soil differs between them.** Aloe and lavender need sandy, fast-draining succulent mix. Mint needs standard potting soil kept consistently moist. Do not put them in the same soil type -- the watering needs are incompatible. Separate pots with appropriate soil for each.

**Harvest regularly.** Mint grows more vigorously when you cut it back. Pinch off the top sets of leaves frequently -- this encourages bushier growth and prevents it from getting leggy and flowering (which reduces leaf flavor). Lavender benefits from cutting flower stalks for drying; this promotes new blooms. Aloe regenerates lower leaves slowly, so always harvest from the outermost, oldest leaves first.

**Keep aloe closest to the stove.** The whole point is speed of access when you burn yourself. Do not put it across the kitchen on a decorative shelf. Put it on the windowsill directly above or beside where you cook.

**Label your mint.** If you grow multiple herbs, mint leaves look similar to several others when you are reaching for something in a hurry. A simple label or a distinctive pot color prevents grabbing the wrong herb when your stomach is in revolt.
