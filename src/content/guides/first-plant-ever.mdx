You have never kept a plant alive. Maybe you have never tried. Maybe you grew up in a house with no plants, or you assume you lack whatever instinct makes people good at this. The internet is not helping -- every beginner guide gives you a list of ten plants, each with different light and water requirements, and expects you to choose. You do not need a list. You need one plant, one set of instructions, and the knowledge that this specific plant will survive your learning curve. This guide gives you exactly that: one plant. Golden pothos. It is the single best first plant you can own, and below is everything you need to know to keep it alive.

## Golden Pothos

Golden pothos is the plant the internet recommends more than any other for beginners, and for once the internet is right. It tolerates low light, irregular watering, dry air, cold drafts, and the kind of sustained inattention that kills every other houseplant. Experienced plant owners call it a weed. That is a compliment. You want a weed right now -- something so determined to live that your inexperience cannot override its survival instincts.

Here is what makes pothos different from the succulents, cacti, and "easy" plants you may have killed or been intimidated by. Those plants die silently. They look fine until they are already dead inside. Pothos communicates. When it is thirsty, its leaves droop visibly. You water it, and within hours the leaves perk back up. This feedback loop is the single most important feature for a first-time plant owner, because it teaches you the one skill that matters: reading what a plant needs. Every other plant you ever own will build on that skill, and pothos is the plant that teaches it without punishing you for being slow to learn.

It also grows fast. Within weeks of bringing it home, you will see new leaves unfurling from the vine tips. That visible growth is motivating in a way that slow-growing succulents and cacti cannot match. You are not just keeping something alive -- you are watching it actively grow because of what you are doing. That feedback is what turns a non-plant-person into a plant person.

**What to buy.** Go to any garden center, hardware store garden section, or grocery store plant display. Look for a golden pothos in a four-inch or six-inch nursery pot. It will have heart-shaped leaves with green and yellow variegation. It should cost between three and eight dollars. Do not buy anything fancy. Do not buy a special pot yet. Just buy the plant in its nursery pot.

**Where to put it.** Anywhere in your home that gets some natural light. A shelf in a room with a window. A kitchen counter. A bathroom with a frosted window. The top of a bookcase. Pothos does not need direct sunlight -- indirect light from a nearby window is perfect. It will even survive in a dim room, though it grows slower and the leaves lose some of their yellow variegation. For your first plant, put it wherever you will see it every day. Visibility is more important than optimal light, because a plant you forget about is a plant you stop watering.

**How to water it.** Stick your finger into the soil up to the first knuckle. If the soil feels dry, water it. If it feels damp, wait. That is the entire method. When you do water, pour water slowly into the pot until it drains out the bottom. Let it drain fully, then put it back. How often will this be? Roughly every one to two weeks, depending on your home's temperature and humidity. But do not water on a schedule -- check the soil. The finger test is more reliable than any calendar.

**What happens when you mess up.** You will overwater it at some point. The leaves will turn yellow. This is not a death sentence -- stop watering, let the soil dry out completely, and the plant recovers. You will forget to water it for three weeks. The leaves will droop dramatically and look lifeless. Water it thoroughly, and within a day the leaves will be upright again. You might put it somewhere too dark. It will grow slowly and the leaves will turn solid green instead of variegated. Move it closer to light and the variegation returns in new growth. Pothos forgives every common beginner mistake. The only way to truly kill it is to leave it in waterlogged soil for weeks, which rots the roots beyond recovery.

**Difficulty:** Beginner
**Light:** Low to bright indirect. Survives almost any indoor light condition.
**Water:** When soil is dry to the touch. Every 1-2 weeks. Droops when thirsty.
**Pet-safe:** No -- calcium oxalate crystals. Toxic to cats and dogs if chewed.
**Child-safe:** Yes (mild irritant if large amounts ingested)

## Setup Tips

**Day one: do nothing special.** Bring the plant home in its nursery pot. Set it on a surface where you will see it daily. Do not repot it, do not fertilize it, do not move it around trying to find the perfect spot. The plant needs a few days to adjust to your home's light and temperature. Leave it alone.

**Day two through seven: just observe.** Look at the leaves. Are they firm and upright? Good. Is the soil moist from the store? Do not water it yet. Wait until the soil dries out, which may take a full week or more. The most common first-week mistake is watering a plant that is already moist because you feel like you should be doing something. You should not. Patience is the first skill.

**End of week one: do the finger test.** Push your finger an inch into the soil. Dry? Water it slowly until water comes out the drainage holes at the bottom. Damp? Check again in three days. This is now your entire care routine. Repeat forever.

**Week two: pick a watering check day.** Choose one day per week -- Sunday works well -- as your "check the soil" day. You are not watering on a schedule; you are checking on a schedule. Some weeks the soil will still be damp and you will skip watering. That is correct. The consistency of checking is what prevents both overwatering and forgetting.

**After one month: consider a decorative pot.** If the plant is alive and growing (it will be), buy a pot you like that is one to two inches wider than the nursery pot. Make sure it has a drainage hole. Slide the plant out of the nursery pot, set it in the new one, and fill around the edges with standard potting soil. This is your first repotting. It takes five minutes, and the plant will respond with faster growth because the roots have more room.
