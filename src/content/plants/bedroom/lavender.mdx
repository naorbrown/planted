## Why Lavender for the Bedroom

Lavender is one of the few plants with genuine clinical evidence supporting its use as a sleep aid. Unlike a plugin diffuser that disperses synthetic fragrance, a living lavender plant releases linalool and linalyl acetate gently and continuously, creating a subtle aromatic environment that your body can adjust to naturally. Place it on a south-facing windowsill near your bed, and the warmth of morning light will release the volatile oils just as you wake.

The relationship between lavender and sleep is not merely folk tradition. Controlled studies have measured reduced heart rate, lower blood pressure, and increased slow-wave sleep (the deepest, most restorative sleep phase) in subjects exposed to lavender aroma. For anyone who struggles with the transition from screen-lit wakefulness to restful sleep, a bedside lavender plant creates a sensory cue that signals your nervous system to downshift.

Beyond sleep, lavender brings a quiet structure to your bedroom. Its silvery-green foliage and upright flower spikes read as intentional and calming rather than cluttered. It is completely safe around curious cats, dogs, and children, making it a rare plant that asks nothing of you except sunlight and restraint with the watering can. The dried flowers are useful long after the bloom fades — tuck them into sachets for drawers, steep them in tea, or scatter them in a warm bath.

## Setup Guide

1. **Choose your pot wisely.** Use a terracotta pot with a drainage hole — terracotta wicks moisture away from roots, which lavender prefers. A 6-8 inch pot suits most nursery starts.
2. **Mix your soil.** Combine 2 parts standard potting soil, 1 part coarse sand, and 1 part perlite. Lavender rots in rich, wet soil. If you only have regular potting mix, increase the perlite to compensate.
3. **Position for maximum light.** Place within 2 feet of your brightest window. Lavender needs 6+ hours of bright light daily. A south or west-facing bedroom window is ideal.
4. **Water sparingly.** Let the soil dry completely between waterings — stick your finger 2 inches deep. If it feels even slightly moist, wait another day. Overwatering is the number one killer of indoor lavender.
5. **Boost airflow.** Lavender dislikes stagnant, humid air. Crack a window when weather permits or run a small fan nearby. Good airflow prevents fungal issues.

## Maintenance Schedule

- **Weekly:** Check soil moisture. In winter, you may only water every 2-3 weeks. In summer with strong light, once per week is typical.
- **Monthly:** Rotate the pot a quarter turn so growth stays even. Gently brush the foliage as you pass — this releases aromatic oils into the air.
- **Seasonally:** After flowering, trim spent flower stalks back to just above the first set of leaves. In early spring, prune lightly to shape and encourage bushy growth. Feed once in spring with a diluted balanced fertilizer.
- **Annually:** Refresh the top inch of soil or repot if rootbound. Lavender rarely needs pots larger than 8 inches.
- **Late summer:** Harvest flower stalks for drying by cutting just as the first flowers open — this is when oil concentration peaks. Hang bundles upside down in a dark, dry room for 2-3 weeks. Dried lavender retains fragrance for 6-12 months and can be used in sachets, teas, and baking.

## Common Problems & Solutions

**Leggy, sparse growth:** Insufficient light. Move closer to a window or supplement with a grow light for 4+ hours daily. Prune leggy stems back by one-third to encourage branching.

**Yellowing lower leaves:** Overwatering or poor drainage. Let soil dry out fully, confirm the drainage hole is clear, and reduce watering frequency. Remove affected leaves.

**No flowers indoors:** Common when light is marginal. Ensure 6+ hours of direct or bright-indirect light. A cool period (50-55°F) for 4-6 weeks in winter can trigger spring blooming.

**Gray mold on stems:** Too much humidity and not enough airflow. Remove affected stems immediately, improve ventilation, and reduce watering. Space away from other plants.

**Root rot (plant wilts despite wet soil):** The roots have drowned. Unpot, trim soft brown roots, let the root ball dry for 24 hours, and repot in completely fresh dry soil. Switch to a terracotta pot if you are currently using plastic or glazed ceramic.

**Whiteflies or aphids:** Rare on lavender but possible indoors, especially in warm months with open windows. Inspect the undersides of leaves regularly. A strong spray of water dislodges most pests. For persistent problems, apply neem oil, ensuring good coverage on leaf undersides.

## Where to Find It

English lavender (Lavandula angustifolia) is widely available at garden centers, nurseries, and home improvement stores year-round. Look for compact cultivars bred for containers: 'Munstead' and 'Hidcote' are proven indoor performers. 'Thumbelina Leigh' is an ultra-compact variety that stays under 12 inches, perfect for nightstand placement. Online specialty herb nurseries often carry rooted starts that ship well.

Avoid purchasing lavender from grocery store floral sections, as those plants are typically forced for display and struggle to adapt to home conditions. Farmers markets in spring and summer often have locally grown starts that are already acclimated to your region's conditions. If you want multiple plants, lavender propagates well from 3-4 inch stem cuttings taken in late spring — strip the lower leaves, dip in rooting hormone, and place in moist perlite. Expect roots in 3-4 weeks.
