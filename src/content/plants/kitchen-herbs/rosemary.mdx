  tcm: "Rosemary (Mi Die Xiang) is warm and pungent, entering the Lung and Liver meridians. It warms kidney yang, invigorates blood circulation, and dispels wind-cold. It is used for cold-type headaches, poor circulation in the extremities, and to support kidney qi in conditions of fatigue and lower back weakness."
  ayurveda: "Rosemary is considered heating and pungent, making it excellent for balancing Kapha (cold, sluggish) constitutions. It kindles agni, clears congestion, and sharpens the mind. However, its heating nature means Pitta types should use it moderately."
  modernScience: "Rosemary contains carnosic acid and 1,8-cineole, compounds studied for neuroprotective and cognitive-enhancing effects. A 2012 study in Therapeutic Advances in Psychopharmacology found that exposure to rosemary aroma significantly improved cognitive performance and mood in test subjects. Carnosic acid has also shown potential in protecting brain cells from oxidative stress in preclinical research."
  folklore: "Rosemary has been the herb of remembrance since ancient Greece, where students wore rosemary garlands during examinations. At funerals, mourners placed sprigs on coffins to say 'I will remember you.' Shakespeare's Ophelia speaks the famous line associating rosemary with remembrance. In medieval Europe, rosemary was burned in sickrooms to purify the air during plague outbreaks."

## Why Rosemary for the Kitchen

Rosemary bridges the gap between culinary herb and cognitive enhancer. While the practical value of having fresh rosemary steps from your oven is obvious to any cook, the less obvious benefit is what the plant does simply by being in the room. Its volatile oils, particularly 1,8-cineole, become airborne at room temperature. Peer-reviewed research has linked rosemary aroma to measurable improvements in memory performance and alertness — making it a functional addition to any kitchen where you also work, plan, or help children with homework.

As a kitchen plant, rosemary demands little and gives generously. It prefers the dry, warm air that kitchens naturally provide, tolerates drought better than most herbs, and its evergreen habit means it looks good year-round without seasonal die-back. A single mature rosemary plant produces enough sprigs for regular cooking plus enough to dry for spice jars, infused oils, and aromatic bundles.

Rosemary also serves as a natural pest deterrent. Its camphor-like volatile oils repel moths, flies, and mosquitoes. In traditional Mediterranean kitchens, rosemary branches were hung near doorways and windows for exactly this purpose. On a kitchen windowsill, the plant performs this function passively, creating an aromatic barrier that insects find disagreeable.

## Setup Guide

1. **Buy a nursery start.** Rosemary is slow and unreliable from seed. A 4-6 inch nursery plant in a healthy, bushy state is the best starting point. Look for upright varieties like 'Tuscan Blue' or 'Miss Jessup's Upright' for indoor growing.
2. **Choose a terracotta pot with drainage.** Terracotta is ideal because it breathes and wicks moisture away from roots. A 6-8 inch pot works for the first year; upgrade to 10-12 inches as the plant matures.
3. **Mix fast-draining soil.** Combine 2 parts potting soil, 1 part coarse sand, and 1 part perlite. Rosemary evolved on rocky Mediterranean hillsides and its roots will rot in dense, moisture-retentive potting mixes.
4. **Place in your sunniest window.** Rosemary needs 6-8 hours of direct sunlight daily. South-facing kitchen windows are ideal. If supplementing with a grow light, position it close — rosemary stretches toward distant light sources and becomes leggy.
5. **Water sparingly and deeply.** Allow the top 2 inches of soil to dry completely between waterings, then water thoroughly until it drains from the bottom. In winter, rosemary needs even less — every 2-3 weeks may suffice.

## Maintenance Schedule

- **Weekly:** Check soil moisture by pressing your finger 2 inches into the soil. Water only when dry at that depth. In winter, extend to every 10-14 days.
- **Biweekly:** Harvest sprigs by cutting stems just above a leaf node. Regular harvesting encourages branching and prevents the plant from becoming woody and bare at the base.
- **Monthly:** Rotate the pot a quarter turn for even growth. Inspect for powdery mildew, especially in winter when air circulation decreases.
- **Seasonally:** In spring, feed once with a balanced organic fertilizer. Rosemary is a light feeder — over-fertilizing produces lush growth with diminished flavor and aroma. Shape the plant with light pruning after any spring growth flush.
- **Annually:** Refresh the top 2 inches of soil. Repot only when visibly rootbound. Rosemary performs well when slightly snug in its container.

## Common Problems & Solutions

**Powdery mildew (white coating on leaves):** The most common indoor rosemary problem, caused by poor air circulation and high humidity. Improve ventilation with a nearby fan, thin dense interior growth, and water from below to keep foliage dry. Remove severely affected branches.

**Needle drop (leaves falling off):** Usually caused by one of three things: sudden temperature change, overwatering, or severe underwatering. Check your recent care routine. If the soil is soggy, let it dry completely. If it is bone dry, water thoroughly. Avoid placing near drafty doors or heating vents.

**Woody, bare lower stems:** Natural aging for rosemary. Prevent it by harvesting regularly from the tips, which forces new growth lower on the plant. Once stems are woody and bare, they rarely produce new leaves — accept them as part of the plant's character.

**Leggy, reaching growth:** Insufficient light. Move to a brighter location or add supplemental lighting. Prune leggy stems back by one-third to encourage compact regrowth.

**Spider mites (tiny webs on stems, stippled leaves):** Common in dry indoor environments. Mist the plant occasionally, wipe leaves with a damp cloth, and treat infestations with insecticidal soap or neem oil.

**Salt buildup on soil surface (white crust):** Caused by mineral deposits from tap water or fertilizer. Scrape off the white crust, flush the soil thoroughly with distilled or filtered water, and reduce fertilizer frequency. Using rainwater or filtered water for regular watering prevents recurrence.

## Where to Find It

Rosemary is available at every garden center, grocery store herb section, and farmers market. For indoor growing, seek out upright cultivars: 'Tuscan Blue,' 'Miss Jessup's Upright,' or 'Arp' (which is also the most cold-hardy if you want to move it outdoors seasonally). Prostrate (trailing) varieties like 'Prostratus' work in hanging planters but produce less harvestable volume. Online herb nurseries ship healthy starts year-round.

Rosemary propagates well from 4-inch stem cuttings dipped in rooting hormone and placed in moist perlite — though it takes 4-8 weeks to root, slower than most herbs. For a faster start, purchase a nursery plant in the 4-6 inch size range. A healthy rosemary plant in a sunny kitchen window can live for years, eventually developing a woody, tree-like character that becomes a permanent feature of the room.
