  tcm: "Mint (Bo He) is cool and pungent, entering the Lung and Liver meridians. It clears wind-heat — the TCM pattern associated with early-stage colds with sore throat, headache, and fever. It also soothes liver qi stagnation, easing irritability and red, swollen eyes. Bo He is a key herb in many classical formulas including Yin Qiao San."
  ayurveda: "Mint is considered cooling and is especially beneficial for Pitta constitutions. It kindles agni (digestive fire) without aggravating Pitta's heat, a rare combination. Mint tea is a traditional remedy for sluggish digestion, nausea, and summer heat. It calms the mind and supports clear breathing, reducing Kapha congestion in the respiratory tract."
  modernScience: "Menthol and related compounds in mint have been studied extensively for gastrointestinal benefits. A 2019 meta-analysis in BMC Complementary Medicine and Therapies found peppermint oil (a close relative of spearmint) significantly reduced symptoms of irritable bowel syndrome. Menthol activates TRPM8 cold receptors, producing the characteristic cooling sensation that also provides mild analgesic and anti-spasmodic effects."
  folklore: "In Greek mythology, Minthe was a naiad nymph loved by Hades. When Persephone discovered the affair, she transformed Minthe into a lowly plant to be trampled underfoot. Hades, unable to reverse the transformation, gave the plant its intoxicating fragrance so it would be noticed whenever stepped upon. This origin story reflects mint's defining quality: the more it is crushed and cut, the more powerfully it releases its scent."

## Why Mint for the Kitchen

Mint is the most immediately useful herb you can grow in a kitchen. Tear a leaf into your morning tea, muddle a sprig into an evening cocktail, scatter ribbons over a fruit salad, blend into chutney, or simply crush a leaf between your fingers when you need a moment of sharp, clean clarity during a long cooking session. No other herb transitions so seamlessly from breakfast to dinner to after-dinner drink.

For families, mint has an additional advantage: it is completely non-toxic. Children can pick leaves, taste them, and help with harvesting without any safety concern. Pets that investigate or chew the leaves face no risk. This makes mint one of the few kitchen plants you can place at counter height in a household with toddlers and cats without a second thought.

The only management challenge mint presents is its vigor. In garden beds, mint is famously invasive, spreading by runners until it colonizes entire yards. In a pot on your kitchen counter, this aggressive growth is an asset — the plant refills itself after heavy harvesting and produces abundantly through the growing season.

Mint also doubles as a gentle digestive remedy — arguably its oldest use. A few leaves steeped in hot water after a heavy meal is a practice shared across cultures from Moroccan tea houses to English country homes. For families with children, mint tea is a safe, caffeine-free drink that kids actually enjoy, making it a practical daily-use herb beyond just cooking.

## Setup Guide

1. **Start from a nursery plant or cutting.** Mint roots so readily that a stem cutting placed in water will show roots within days. A 4-inch nursery pot gives you immediate harvesting ability. Spearmint is the best all-purpose kitchen variety; peppermint is stronger and better suited to teas and desserts.
2. **Use a wide, shallow pot.** Mint spreads horizontally via runners (stolons), not deeply. A pot that is 8-10 inches wide and 6 inches deep is more useful than a tall, narrow one. Ensure it has drainage holes.
3. **Fill with standard potting mix.** Unlike most herbs in this collection, mint actually prefers rich, moisture-retentive soil. Standard indoor potting mix without extra drainage amendments works perfectly.
4. **Place in moderate light.** Mint does best with 4-6 hours of light but tolerates partial shade better than most herbs. An east-facing kitchen window is ideal. It can also thrive under standard kitchen fluorescent lighting.
5. **Water to keep soil consistently moist.** Unlike rosemary and lavender, mint wants regular moisture. Water when the top half-inch of soil feels dry, which in an active kitchen may be every 2-3 days.
6. **Contain it.** Never plant mint in the same pot as other herbs. It will outcompete and overwhelm them within weeks. One mint plant per pot, always.

## Maintenance Schedule

- **Every 2-3 days:** Check soil moisture. Mint wilts dramatically when dry but recovers quickly once watered. Consistent moisture produces the best-flavored leaves.
- **Weekly:** Harvest by cutting stems just above a leaf node. Regular harvesting prevents flowering and keeps the plant producing tender new leaves. Use what you cut — mint freezes well in ice cube trays with water or olive oil.
- **Biweekly:** Pinch off any flower buds that appear. Flowering redirects the plant's energy away from leaf production and makes existing leaves less flavorful.
- **Monthly:** Feed with a balanced liquid fertilizer at half strength during the growing season. Mint is a moderately heavy feeder given its fast growth rate.
- **Seasonally:** If the plant becomes root-bound and tangled, unpot it, divide the root mass into 2-3 sections, and repot each in fresh soil. This refreshes growth and gives you plants for other rooms or to share.

## Common Problems & Solutions

**Leggy growth with small leaves:** Insufficient light. Move to a brighter location or supplement with a small grow light. Prune leggy stems back to a strong leaf node to encourage bushy regrowth.

**Wilting despite regular watering:** Check for root binding — mint in a small pot can become so rootbound that water runs straight through without being absorbed. If roots are circling densely, it is time to divide and repot.

**Brown leaf edges:** Underwatering or very dry air. Increase watering frequency and consider misting in dry winter months. Group with other plants to raise ambient humidity.

**Rust (orange-brown spots on leaf undersides):** A fungal infection common in crowded, poorly ventilated conditions. Remove affected leaves immediately, thin the plant to improve airflow, and avoid wetting foliage when watering. Severely infected plants should be discarded and replaced with a fresh start.

**Flavor becoming bitter or weak:** The plant has likely bolted (flowered) or is overly mature. Cut the entire plant back to 2 inches above the soil line. It will regenerate with fresh, flavorful growth within 2-3 weeks.

**Aphids clustering on new growth:** Mint's tender young shoots attract aphids. Blast them off with a strong spray of water in the sink, or wipe with a damp cloth. For persistent infestations, a diluted soap spray (1 teaspoon castile soap per quart of water) is safe for edible herbs. Rinse harvested leaves thoroughly.

## Where to Find It

Mint is available everywhere — grocery stores, garden centers, farmers markets, and often in the yards of willing neighbors. For kitchen growing, spearmint (Mentha spicata) is the most versatile culinary variety. Peppermint (Mentha x piperita) is better for teas and medicinal use. Specialty varieties like chocolate mint, apple mint, and Mojito mint are available from herb nurseries and online retailers. Propagation is trivially easy: place a 4-inch stem cutting in a glass of water on your windowsill. Roots appear in 3-5 days. Plant in soil once roots are an inch long.
