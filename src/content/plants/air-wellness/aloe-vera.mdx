## Why Aloe Vera for Air Wellness

Aloe Vera is that rare plant where folklore and modern science converge completely. The same gel that ancient Egyptians called the "plant of immortality" has been validated by clinical trials showing genuine wound-healing, anti-inflammatory, and antibacterial properties. Having a living Aloe in your kitchen or bathroom means having an immediate first-aid resource for minor burns, cuts, and skin irritation -- snap a leaf, apply the gel, and benefit from thousands of years of verified medicinal use.

Beyond the medicine cabinet benefits, Aloe quietly purifies indoor air, removing formaldehyde and benzene. It asks almost nothing in return -- bright light, occasional water, and benign neglect. The plant also serves as a living air quality indicator: brown spots on its leaves can signal excessive airborne chemicals, alerting you to ventilation issues before they affect your health.

## Setup Guide

1. **Place in your brightest spot.** A south or west-facing windowsill is perfect. Aloe tolerates bright indirect light but rewards full sun exposure with compact, robust growth and more vivid coloring.
2. **Use a terra cotta pot with drainage.** Unglazed terra cotta wicks moisture from the soil, which prevents the root rot that kills more Aloe plants than anything else. The pot should be only slightly wider than the plant's root mass.
3. **Mix fast-draining soil.** Combine 2 parts coarse sand or perlite with 1 part standard potting soil. Pre-mixed cactus and succulent soil works, but adding extra perlite improves drainage further.
4. **Position in the kitchen or bathroom.** Keep it within arm's reach for medicinal use. A kitchen windowsill near the stove means burn treatment is seconds away. Just ensure the bathroom has a window -- Aloe needs real light, not just fluorescent.
5. **Keep away from cats and dogs.** Aloe latex (the yellow layer beneath the outer skin) contains anthraquinones that cause vomiting and diarrhea in pets. The inner gel is the medicinal part and is generally safe for human external use. Children are safe around the plant as the thick leaves are not appealing to chew.
6. **Leave room for pups.** Mature Aloe plants produce offsets (pups) around their base. Use a pot wide enough to accommodate 2-3 pups before you need to separate and repot.

## Maintenance Schedule

**Every 2-3 weeks:** Water deeply but infrequently. Soak the soil thoroughly, then allow it to dry out completely before watering again. Insert your finger 2-3 inches deep -- if there is any moisture, wait. In winter, reduce to once monthly. Overwatering is the single most common way people kill Aloe.

**Monthly:** Rotate the plant a quarter-turn to prevent it from leaning toward the light source. Check for mealybugs at leaf bases where they hide in the tight rosette structure.

**Seasonally:** Feed once in spring and once in midsummer with a diluted succulent fertilizer (half strength). Aloe is a light feeder and over-fertilizing causes soft, floppy growth that is more susceptible to rot.

**As needed:** Harvest gel by cutting a mature outer leaf at the base with a clean knife. Let the yellow latex drip out for a few minutes (this is the irritant), then fillet the leaf to expose the clear gel. Use fresh or refrigerate in a sealed container for up to a week.

**Every 2-3 years:** Repot when pups crowd the pot or the mother plant becomes top-heavy. Separate pups that have their own root systems and pot individually. Let divided plants callous for 24 hours before potting to prevent rot.

## Common Problems & Solutions

**Soft, mushy leaves:** Root rot from overwatering. Unpot immediately, remove all mushy roots with a sterile blade, let the plant dry for 2-3 days on newspaper, and repot in completely dry, fast-draining mix. Do not water for at least a week after repotting.

**Brown, shriveled leaf tips:** Underwatering or chemical burn from overfertilizing. If the soil has been bone dry for over a month, give a thorough soak. If recently fertilized, flush the soil with plain water.

**Elongated, pale growth (etiolation):** Insufficient light. The rosette stretches upward seeking sun, producing thin, weak leaves. Move to a brighter location. The stretched growth cannot be reversed, but new growth will be compact.

**Red or brown discoloration on leaves:** Sun stress from sudden exposure to intense direct light. This is cosmetic, not harmful, and often resolves as the plant acclimates. Introduce direct sun gradually over 1-2 weeks.

**Flat, thin leaves despite adequate light:** The plant is using its stored water reserves. Increase watering frequency slightly. Healthy, hydrated Aloe leaves should be plump, firm, and slightly concave on top.

**Pups overwhelming the pot:** A sign of a healthy, happy plant. Separate pups in spring when they are 3-4 inches tall with their own roots. Share them -- Aloe pups make excellent gifts.

## Where to Find It

Aloe Vera is one of the most affordable and widely available houseplants. Find it at any garden center, hardware store, grocery store, or even dollar stores for $3-15. Large mature specimens run $15-30. For medicinal-grade varieties, look for Aloe barbadensis miller specifically (some decorative Aloe species are not medicinal). Local succulent societies and plant swaps often have mature pups for free. Online, Mountain Crest Gardens, Succulents Box, and Amazon offer healthy specimens shipped bare-root. When buying, choose a plant with thick, firm, upright leaves with no soft spots or browning at the base.
