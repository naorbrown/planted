      <p>
        We spend over 90% of our time indoors. The air we breathe, the spaces we work in, the rooms where our children sleep — these environments shape our health, mood, and productivity in ways we rarely think about.
      </p>

      <p>
        Plant Therapy exists to change that. Inspired by places like Singapore's Changi Airport — where architecture and nature blend seamlessly — we believe every space can benefit from the right plant.

      <h2>What makes us different</h2>

      <p>
        Most plant guides tell you what a plant needs. We tell you what a plant <em>does</em> — for your air, your sleep, your focus, your children's safety, and your wellbeing.
      </p>

      <p>
        We draw from multiple knowledge traditions: NASA's Clean Air Study for air purification data, Traditional Chinese Medicine for understanding plant energetics, Ayurvedic wisdom for holistic wellness, and modern peer-reviewed research for evidence-based recommendations.
      </p>

      <h2>Our principles</h2>

      <ul>
        <li><strong>Accessible.</strong> Every plant we recommend is easy to find — at local nurseries, hardware stores, or from seed. No rare specimens that require specialist sourcing.</li>
        <li><strong>Safe.</strong> Every plant is marked for pet and child toxicity. We always provide non-toxic alternatives.</li>
        <li><strong>Complete.</strong> From pot selection to soil mix to maintenance schedules — everything you need from start to thriving plant.</li>
        <li><strong>Honest.</strong> We note when the science is strong and when it's more traditional wisdom. You decide what matters to you.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Use-case driven</h2>

      <p>
        Plants are organized by where you want them, not by what they are. Looking for something for your bedroom that helps you sleep? Your home office that helps you focus? A kitchen herb that also repels insects? We start with the problem, then find the plant.
